Online learning algorithms
==========================

Implements a few online algorithms in the setting of online learning with expert advice:

* External regret minimization: exponentially-weighted average forecaster
* Internal regret minimization: reduction to external regret minimization from Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (chapter 4)
* Online calibration: via internal regret minimization
* Online recalibration: uses online calibration method as a subroutine

See `./examples` folder for details on how to run the algorithms.
